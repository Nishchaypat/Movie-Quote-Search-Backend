Movie Quote Search application is a web-based tool that enables users to conveniently search for and explore movie quotes based on specific search terms.

The Movie Quote Search application is a web-based tool that allows users to search for movie quotes based on a specific search term. Whether you're looking for a memorable line from a classic film or trying to find the origin of a popular quote, this application provides a convenient way to discover and explore movie quotes.

The application leverages the power of OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to analyze and compare the semantic similarity between search terms and the stored movie quotes. By utilizing the pre-trained embeddings of the movie quotes, the application can efficiently identify and retrieve the most relevant quotes that match the user's search input.

Key Features of the Movie Quote Search application:

Efficient Search: 
The application employs advanced text embedding techniques to quickly search and retrieve the most relevant movie quotes based on the user's search term.

Semantic Similarity:
By utilizing the text-embedding-ada-002 model, the application considers the semantic meaning of the search term, allowing for a more accurate and contextualized search experience.

Top Matching Results: 
The application provides the top matching quotes based on the search term, allowing users to find the most relevant quotes without sifting through a large number of results.

User-Friendly Interface:
